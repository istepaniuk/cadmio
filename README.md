Cadmio
======

Cadmio is a proof of concept program to test the current state of Mono development tools and libraries.

It is a GTK application using an OpenGL viewport, it allows mouse zoom and navigation as well as projecting cursor coordinates over the gound plane in the screen.

The code is pretty much cowboy-style. I revived this project that I wrote several years ago, solely for the purpose of rewriting it using TDD and refactoring procedures that I have learnt since then.

It depends on the TAO framework.
